## Objective
The objective of this project is to demonstrate the following:
- Designing a data pipeline for handling stock market data points
- Integrating with an API to send and retrieve data points
- Performing ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations on the data points
- Creating a real-time data pipeline for continuous data ingestion
- Developing a simple machine learning model to predict the opening price

## Features
- Downloads historical stock market data points from a public service (Yahoo Finance)
- Implements a mock API using Flask for data ingestion and retrieval
- Performs ETL operations to clean, transform, and load data into a PostgreSQL database
- Creates a real-time data pipeline for continuous data updates
- Develops a basic machine learning model (linear regression) to predict opening prices
- Provides an example schema for the PostgreSQL database

## Requirements
- Python 3.9.7
- Libraries specified in the `requirements.txt` file
